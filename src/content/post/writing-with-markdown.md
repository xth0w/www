Posts live as `.md` files in `src/content/post/`. The filename becomes the URL slug. Frontmatter fields are validated by
Zod — see `src/content.config.ts` for the schema.

## Frontmatter shape

```yaml
---
title: "Your post title"
publishDate: 2026-01-12
description: "One-sentence summary used in cards, social previews, and meta tags."
tags: [ tag-one, tag-two ]
# updatedDate: 2026-02-01      # optional — shown as "Updated …" on the post
# draft: true                   # excludes the post from production builds
# coverImage:                   # optional — appears between header and body
#   src: ./_assets/cover.png
#   alt: "Description for screen readers"
---
```

`title`, `publishDate`, and `description` are required.

## What's pre-wired

- **Headings** auto-generate `id`s and a `#` anchor on hover/touch — click to copy a deep link.
- **Lazy images** in the post body fade in when they enter the viewport.
- **Reading progress bar** at the top tracks scroll position.
- **Drop cap** on the first paragraph (large italic accent letter, like the one starting this post).
- **Share buttons** at the foot: X, LinkedIn, copy-link.
- **Prev/next post navigation** at the foot, ordered by publish date.
